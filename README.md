# ML Heart Disease Classification

Python-based machine model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

## Description

ML Heart Disease Classification is a scikit-learn based machine learning project that develops a predictive model capable of determining the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on their medical attributes. This project utilizes several machine learning techniques and data analysis to provide a valuable tool for preliminary health assessments and medical research.

### Key Features:
* Predictive Modeling: Implements various machine learning algorithms to develop a robust model that accurately predicts heart disease presence.
* Data Preprocessing: Includes comprehensive steps for cleaning and preparing data, ensuring the model receives high-quality inputs for better accuracy.
* Feature Engineering: Enhances the dataset with derived attributes that are crucial for making accurate predictions about heart disease.
* Model Evaluation: Utilizes a range of metrics and validation techniques to assess the performance and reliability of the predictive models.
* Visualization: Provides visualizations of data and model performance metrics, helping to understand the model's predictions and the importance of different features.

This application is designed for professionals seeking a tool to simulate early diagnosis required for accurate predictions for studies and trials.
